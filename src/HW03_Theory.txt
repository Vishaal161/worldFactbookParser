/*
 * 1. A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between 
 *    two programs running on a network connection. It is bound to a port 
 *    number so that the TCP layer can successfully send data to the 
 *    correct location. 
 *    A Socket object is used for a client, is bound to a specific port, and
 *    implements one side of a two-way connection. On the other hand,
 *    a ServerSocket object implements a socket that servers can use to listen 
 *    for and accept connections from clients. 
 *    
 * 2. If this happens (like if the port is being used), then the Socket throws
 *    an exception (java.net.ConnectException) and the Server has no choice but 
 *    to exit. Communication is not possible because the client cannot read
 *    and write from the socket. 
 *    
 * 3. Paper Program - 
 *    The server should do the math and return the answer to the client.  
 *    I have included my Server.java in my hw03 zip file. This is the only
 *    file where I made modifications. 
 *    	
 * 
 * PROGRAMMING
 *
 * [ASSUMPTIONS MADE] 
 * 1. I hardcoded the territories/islands that my program should not consider 
 *    a country (see CollectData.java). 
 * 2. I also hardcoded Pennsylvania's total area and US's sea level. 
 * 3. Because of the format of their
 *    population statistics, the United States and Zambia return NumberFormatExceptions.
 *    Instead of writing out the full number as in 123,456, for example, Zambia's 
 *    population is listed as "15.972 million" for some reason. This is noted when I
 *    calculate Electricity Consumption Per Capita. 
 *
 *

 *    location of such countries was vague, often saying that some parts of the country are in Asia
 *    and other parts in Europe.

 *    one country so I found all landlocked countries then manually narrowed down the countries
 *    landlocked by only one country.
